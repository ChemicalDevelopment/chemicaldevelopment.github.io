First, follow [Setup]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fractalrender/setup)

Now, run

`./run.py -d 800 800 -i 32 -z .6 -c -.75 0`

This should take a little bit of time, but willl quickly generate a zoomed out image of the whole mandelbrot set.

Personally, I like the point `-c .2821 .01`. This is good to zoom in to about `-z 1000000`

However, you will need to up the number of iterations to about `-i 500` by then.
