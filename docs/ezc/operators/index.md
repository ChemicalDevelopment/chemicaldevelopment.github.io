title: EZC Operators
---

Similar to [functions]({{site.ezc_docs}}/functions), operators are a shortcut to functions.

You can use them like this `y = x + b` instead of the normal `y = add x b`

Essentially, each operator maps to a function, as `+` maps to `add`, `^` and `**` both map to `pow`, and so on.

You can not use literals `.221`, `-1.0`, etc with operators; you must use variables
