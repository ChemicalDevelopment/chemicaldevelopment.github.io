### Pi

Pi, or $\pi$, is a widely known constant, and any circle's circumference divided by diameter.

It's numerical value is `3.14159265358979 . . .` In this example, we'll show how to use ezC to compute pi to any accuracy.

#### Basic Example

Here is a very basic, but slow method of calculating pi:

``` c
return (2 + (long)3);
```

since `-1` is the $\cos(\pi)$, $\cos^{-1}(-1)$ should be $\pi$
