The 2017-2018 school year was hectic and uncertain at the L&N STEM Academy. The administration was placed on leave following a scandal. As a result, Cade Brown recorded this track as a sort of 'anthem' for students and faculty to rally behind. Another student, Lil Chex Mix, was featured in it. Soon after the song released, it had gathered over 1,000 plays on SoundCloud. Eventually, at the L&N STEM 2018 Prom, Cade Brown made it rain while the DJs played this song.
