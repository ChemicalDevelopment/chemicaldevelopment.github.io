title: Awesome sums and products
---

Have you ever seen a really awesome sum? Like this one here:

$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

Or

$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^4} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \frac{1}{3^4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^4} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^4}{90}$$

Or even

$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^{14}} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2^{14}} + \frac{1}{3^{14}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^{14}} + \cdots = \frac{2\pi^{14}}{18243224}$$


Or maybe an awesome product, such as:

$$\frac{\sqrt[1]{e}\sqrt[3]{e}\sqrt[5]{e}\sqrt[7]{e}\sqrt[9]{e}\cdots\sqrt[{2n+1}]{e}\cdots}{\sqrt[2]{e}\sqrt[4]{e}\sqrt[8]{e}\sqrt[10]{e}\sqrt[12]{e}\cdots\sqrt[{2n}]{e}\cdots} = 2$$


The first two are examples of infinite sums, and the third is an infinite product. Sum means adding, product means multiply. In all of these examples, we take them out to infinity (theoretically), and this is the answer we would get. In fact, as we go farther, they get very close to these values.

Before I show you these examples, we are going to look at sums a little bit more generally. For example, lets take a series $ a_n $, and we denote sum with the sigma ($ \Sigma $ with lower and upper bounds $ \sum_{k=1}^m a_k $) let's say that $ a_n = n $

Then $ \sum_{k=1}^{m} a_k = \frac{m(m+1)}{2} $
