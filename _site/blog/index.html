			<span class="date">22 May 2016</span>
			<section class="box special">
				Have you ever seen a really awesome sum? Like this one here:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}</script>

Or

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^4} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \frac{1}{3^4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^4} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^4}{90}</script>

Or even

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^{14}} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2^{14}} + \frac{1}{3^{14}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^{14}} + \cdots = \frac{2\pi^{14}}{18243224}</script>

Or maybe an awesome product, such as:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\sqrt[1]{e}\sqrt[3]{e}\sqrt[5]{e}\sqrt[7]{e}\sqrt[9]{e}\cdots\sqrt[{2n+1}]{e}\cdots}{\sqrt[2]{e}\sqrt[4]{e}\sqrt[8]{e}\sqrt[10]{e}\sqrt[12]{e}\cdots\sqrt[{2n}]{e}\cdots} = 2</script>

The first two are examples of infinite sums, and the third is an infinite product. Sum means adding, product means multiply. In all of these examples, we take them out to infinity (theoretically), and this is the answer we would get. In fact, as we go farther, they get very close to these values.

Before I show you these examples, we are going to look at sums a little bit more generally.

I’ve written a JSFiddle so you can enter your own series and watch the value it converges to.

Full version at <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/tdxofngq/" target="_blank">https://jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/tdxofngq/</a>

<iframe width="100%" height="775" src="//jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/tdxofngq/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

You can just type in “n”, and it will show you the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + … + n (which happens to be $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $)

A few cool sums to try in it:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ {(-1)}^n}{n} = -\ln{2} \approx -.693</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 1
 max = 1000
 series = pow(-1, n) / n
</code></pre>
</div>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{ {(-1)}^n}{2n + 1} = \frac{\pi}{4} \approx .785</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 0
 max = 1000
 series = pow(-1, n) / (2 * n + 1)
</code></pre>
</div>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx 1.645</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 1
 max = 1000
 series = 1 / (n * n)
</code></pre>
</div>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{e}{\pi^{e^{n}}} - \frac{21(e^n + \pi^n)}{10(e^{\pi^n} + \pi^{e^n})}} \approx -0.001</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 0
 max = 100
 series = e / pow(pi, pow(e, n)) - (21 * (pow(e, n) + pow(pi, n))) / (10 * (pow(e, pow(pi, n)) + pow(pi, pow(e, n))))
</code></pre>
</div>

The last one is a bit crazy, and has no practical meaning (yet!), but it shows how you can enter terms into the web page.

Those 4 above are what are called convergent series. Convergent means that if you keep evaluating more and more terms, it tends towards a limit.

Like $ \ln{2} $, or $ \frac{\pi}{4} $ were the limits of the first and second sum.

The first 3 sums converge quite slowly, and to get $d$ digits of precision to the “actual value” (if we could take it to infinity), we would need roughly $10^d$ terms. So, to get one more digit of precision, we would need 10 times as many terms to sum! That is why the first 3 are not good ways to calculate their sum ($\pi$, $\ln{2}$, etc)

The fourth, however, takes roughly $\log\log{d}$ terms to get to $d$ digits, which is very fast.

There exists formulas for $\pi$ that require only $\frac{d}{14}$ terms to get $d$ digits, such as this one:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{\pi} = 12\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n(6n)!(13591409+545140134n)}{(3n)!(n)!^3(640320)^{3n+\frac{3}{2}}} \approx 0.318</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 0
 max = 10
 series = 12 * (pow(-1, n) * fac(6 * n) * (13591409 + 545140134 * n)) / (fac(3 * n) * pow(fac(n), 3) * pow(640320, 3 * n + 1.5))
</code></pre>
</div>

Viola! You have $\frac{1}{\pi}$ pretty easily.

In fact, that series (with a few optimizations) is how record number of digits of $\pi$ are computed! (http://www.numberworld.org/digits/Pi/ we are currently at $13,300,000,000,000$ digits).

Lets take a little break, and talk about products. I showed you:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\sqrt[1]{e}\sqrt[3]{e}\sqrt[5]{e}\sqrt[7]{e}\sqrt[9]{e}\cdots\sqrt[{2n+1}]{e}\cdots}{\sqrt[2]{e}\sqrt[4]{e}\sqrt[8]{e}\sqrt[10]{e}\sqrt[12]{e}\cdots\sqrt[{2n}]{e}\cdots} = 2</script>

and, I showed an example of a seemingly unrelated sum:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ {(-1)}^n}{n} = \ln{2}</script>

But, these two are saying the same thing! I’ll show you how.

Lets get some notation here. Analogous to summing over n using $\Sigma$, we will show a product using capital pi ($\Pi$, <em>not</em> $\pi$).

For example:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\prod_{n=1}^{m}{n} = 1 * 2 * 3 * \cdots * (n - 1) * n = n! = \Gamma(n + 1)</script>

where the $!$ means factorial (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial</a>), and $\Gamma$ is the Gamma function (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function</a>)

I’ve written another fiddle for products instead of summation:

Full version at <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/smnohszh/1/" target="_blank">https://jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/smnohszh/1/</a>

<iframe width="100%" height="775" src="//jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/smnohszh/1/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The default product approaches $\frac{\pi}{2}$, but I have a few examples for these as well:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\left ( {1 + \frac{1}{9n^2}} \right ) = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi} \approx 0.827</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 1
 max = 100
 series = (1 - 1 / (9 * n * n))
</code></pre>
</div>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\left ( 1 + \frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} \right ) = \frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.785</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 1
 max = 100
 series = (1 - 1 / ((2 * n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)))
</code></pre>
</div>

Throughout history, sums have been studied more for two major reasons:

<ul>
  <li>Sums often converge quicker</li>
  <li>It is easier to add than multiply</li>
</ul>

My favorite sum, personally, would have to be the chudnovsky formula, from above:

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{\pi} = 12\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n(6n)!(13591409+545140134n)}{(3n)!(n)!^3(640320)^{3n+\frac{3}{2}}} \approx 0.318</script>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> min = 0
 max = 10
 series = 12 * (pow(-1, n) * fac(6 * n) * (13591409 + 545140134 * n)) / (fac(3 * n) * pow(fac(n), 3) * pow(640320, 3 * n + 1.5))
</code></pre>
</div>

So beautiful!

			<h3><a href="/2016/05/19/primes.html">All about primes</a></h3>
			<span class="date">19 May 2016</span>
			<section class="box special">
				First post on this blog, so I thought we would start it out with something interesting, like primes.

We include some JSFiddles so you can see all the code available with it!

So, lets start out with what they are.

<h1 id="what-are-primes">What are primes?</h1>

Most of the time, you might get something like

<blockquote>
  A prime is any positive integer greater than one whose only postive divisors are 1 and itself
</blockquote>

but I prefer to say that a prime is any integer that you can’t make by multiplying two other integers.

For example, 2 is the first prime, 3 is the next. 4 isn’t a prime, though, because 4 = 2 * 2, which means it has other divisors (2), and thus can be made my multiplying two other integers.

I’ve written a little JSFiddle so that you can see if a number is prime. This is a <em>very</em> unoptimized version of primality testing (testing if a number is prime), but you can see how a basic version works.

Full version at <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/x9h5buwa/2/" target="_blank">https://jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/x9h5buwa/2/</a>

<iframe width="100%" height="775" src="//jsfiddle.net/CadeBrown/x9h5buwa/2/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

This program takes the remainder dividing your input by all numbers less than it (actually, the square root of it, but that is a simple optimization), and if it is zero, that means the number is divisible by some other number, and is therefore not prime.

One common question is

<blockquote>
  Why isn’t 1 or 0 prime?
</blockquote>

And this was a large argument for years. 1 and 0 are not considered prime for a few reasons. The first is the nice property that is called unique factorization, which states that any given integer has exactly one way to factor into primes. For example, 12 = 2 * 2 * 3, and you can’t get 12 from any other primes than 2, 2, and 3. If we said that 1 is a prime, we could have 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 and 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 1 . We have agreed that this is a nice property to have. 1 is what is called a unit. As is negative one, which brings us to our next question:

<blockquote>
  If 2 is a prime, then isn’t -2 ?
</blockquote>

And the answer is: Sort of.

This is because -2 is similar to +2, one is multiplied by the unit 1, while the other is multiplied by the unit -1 . We only consider a number prime if it is positive, though.

<blockquote>
  Are there infinitely many primes?
</blockquote>

Yes, there are. Primes get very far apart (however, there are infinitely many primes <em>exactly</em> 246 apart (<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/20141210-prime-gap-grows-after-decades-long-lull/" target="_blank">https://www.quantamagazine.org/20141210-prime-gap-grows-after-decades-long-lull/</a>))

I’ve written a little fiddle to graph how quickly the number of primes grows, and a few approximations to the actual line

<h1 id="history-of-primes">History of Primes</h1>

Primes have been in people’s thoughts ever since hunter-gatherer days (They thought about dividing food up. How do you give out 13 orange to 3 people?).

Primes are something that are so tangible, like rearranging fruits to divvy up, but yet so mysterious, we don’t even know if there are infinitely many primes that differ by 2!

People have studied primes initially for dividing up resources, which is still useful today, but primes are also used in cutting edge technologies, such as cryptography. While I won’t get into cryptography in this post, suffice it to say that bigger primes are more secure to encrypt data and then decrypt it because the hacker in between doesn’t have the computing power to factor out large primes (which is a very computation-heavy task).

Currently, the largest known prime is $ 2^{74,207,281}-1 $ which is more than 22 million digits long!

The largest prime found by hand was $ 2^{127} - 1 $, or $ 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,727 $ Imagine doing that by hand!

Just think about that for a second. No two integers can be multiplied to get $ 2^{127} - 1 $, but $ 2^{127} $ is just 2 multiplied by itself 126 times!

Another reason I like that number is the fact that $ 2^{127} - 1  = 2^{2^{7} - 1} - 1 = 2^{2^{2^{3} - 1} - 1} - 1 = 2^{2^{2^{2^{2} - 1} - 1} - 1} - 1 $

Math is magic!
