    <p>
        ChemicalDevelopment is a <a href="https://github.com/chemicaldevelopment/">software company</a>, supporter of open source development, <a href="/music/">music label</a>, and much more! We try and make all of our projects easy to learn from and expand upon, which means most of our software projects are Free and Open Source!
    </p>

    <p>
        We've fulfilled needs locally, including the <a href="https://lnstempunks.org/">FRC (Robotics) Team #3966</a> with robotics programming and website development (please see <a href="http://programming.lnstempunks.org/">http://programming.lnstempunks.org/</a>). Also, we help run the L&amp;N STEM Academy's 3D printing and 3D animation resources (cluster rendering). We've given help running the "Open House" and gave a demonstration of the 3D printing/animation facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Originally Cade Brown's solo indie music label, we've expanded to include other artists from multiple genres, such as: RUN! RUN! RUN! (indie), JDavi$.24 (hip hop/trap), and other in-the-works projects! You can check out our full music catalog at <a href="/music/">/music/</a>.
