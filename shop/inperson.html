If you live in Knoxville, don't want to use a shipping provider, and come to our school (L&N STEM Academy), we can arrange an in-person pickup.

    </p>
    <p>
When you check the 'in-person pickup' box on a product page, the shipping amount is set to 0, and a note is sent to ChemicalDevelopment.
    </p>

    <p>
After the order is placed, you will get an email from info@chemicaldevelopment.us to finalize the in-person meetup (we will ask what grade, classes, etc) and once given the information, arrange a time and place to deliver the product.
